            <p>Hi there! My name is Lucas Quatorze and I'm an international student seeking to become a full-stack web developer. 
                Thanks for checking out my website!
            </p>
            <p>Born in Switzerland to Brazilian parents but raised in Brazil and Mexico, I now am continuing my journey up
                the American continent by attending school in Austin, Texas. 
            </p>
            <p>I moved to the United States in 2014 in pursuit of my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Texas at Austin.
                After being rejected from both the Business and Architecture schools, and taking classes in countless different fields like 
                Advertising and Entrepreneurship, I settled in the Liberal Arts school with Sociology as my major. I struggled a lot finding direction in life, I have yet 
                to finish my Bachelor's degree as I realized that Sociology is definetely not the career path that I was looking for. That's
                when I decided to pursue a career in Web Development by enrolling in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp, and I'm absolutely loving
                it so far!
            </p>
            <p> I have moderate experience in the fields of Retail, Marketing, Advertising and Product Management. My first professional experience was
                working as a Creative intern for Ogilvy & Mather Mexico. I have also worked as a Marketing intern for Gemalto (now called Thales Group), as a Retail
                Associate at UT Austin's University Co-op, and as a Product Management intern at FonYou Mexico. Hopefully I'll soon be working as a Junior Web Developer!
            </p>
            <p>I am interested in learning about new opportunities and can be reached through my GitHub profile or by email:
