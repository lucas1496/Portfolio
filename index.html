            <p>Hi there! My name is Lucas Quatorze and I'm an international student seeking to become a full-stack web developer. 
                Thanks for checking out my website!
            </p>
            <p>I was born in Switzerland to Brazilian parents but raised in Brazil and Mexico. I then moved to Austin, Texas after 
                graduating high school in Mexico City to further my studies. 
            </p>
            <p>I moved to the United States in 2014 in pursuit of my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Texas at Austin.
                I took many classes in countless different fields such as Advertising, Entrepreneurship, and even Architecture. I eventually
                settled in the Liberal Arts school with Sociology as my major after completing a certificate in Business Administration. I was struggling a lot to find my direction
                in life, that's when I decided to pursue a career in Web Development by enrolling in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp!
            </p>
            <p> I have moderate experience in the fields of Retail, Marketing, Advertising and Product Management. My first professional experience was
                working as a Creative intern for Ogilvy & Mather Mexico. I have also worked as a Marketing intern for Gemalto (now called Thales Group), as a Retail
                Associate at UT Austin's University Co-op, and as a Product Management intern at FonYou Mexico. Hopefully I'll soon be working as a Junior Web Developer!
            </p>
            <p>I am interested in learning about new opportunities and can be reached through my GitHub profile or by email:
